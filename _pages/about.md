About
=====
Hi! I am Ming, an early career researcher at the University of Oxford in the [Department of Biology](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/). I am a theoretical and evolutionary biologist by training with a background in entomology. My research has a focus on the trait or population dynamics over time, where ecological processes and evolutionary processes occur at a similar pace.
